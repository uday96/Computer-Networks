COMMENTS:

• This is a Sliding Window Go-Back-N(GBN) reliable transmission protocol implementation.
• The Sender initially send a Window of Packets to the Receiver
• The Receiver send an ACK packet if the received packet is the expected packet
• For every ACK received, the Window slides by one unit, sending the next packet
• In case a packet is dropped, Timeout occurs and a new Window from last Unacknowledged packet is sent


ISSUES:

• Timeouts for few packets are less than 1 milli second, Java socket timeout rounds its to 0. For such cases I am setting timeout to 1 milli second.
